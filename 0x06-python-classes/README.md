# PYTHON: Object Oriented Programing

Like other general-purpose programming languages, Python is also an object-oriented language since its beginning. It allows us to develop applications using an Object-Oriented approach. In Python, we can easily create and use classes and objects.

An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. The object is related to real-word entities such as book, house, pencil, etc. The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code. It is a widespread technique to solve the problem by creating objects.

Major principles of object-oriented programming system are given below:

- Class
- Object
- Method
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction
- Encapsulation
