## Python: Almost A Circle

A project that helps us to review different kinds of data, class structures that will have built-in features as:

- ID
- Size values: "Height" and "Weight"
- Position values: 'x' and 'y'
- Sizes

For this we will implement:
- Object classes with heritances
- List of objects
- Directories

### Models

| File/Models       | Description                                                               | Features  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| base.py           | A base class/object                                                       |           |
| rectangle.py      | A child class/object which inherits features from "base"                  |           |
| square.py         | A child class/object which inherits features from "base" and "rectangle"  |           |
