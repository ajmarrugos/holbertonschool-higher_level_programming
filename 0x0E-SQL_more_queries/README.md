## SQL: More Queries

This project serves as learning path to understand some basic DataBase concepts and uses of MySQL.
Here you will see a review of some of the structures we handle in MySQL:

- DATABASES
- TABLES
- VALUES

Some of the commands implemented in this exercise were:

| Command       | Use/Description                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SHOW          | Will show/list a database or elements of a database                   |
| CREATE        | Will create a database or elements of a database                      |
| SET           | Will set or assign a data value                                       |
| INSERT        | Will insert data into a given location or element in a database       |
| UPDATE        | Will update elements or data of a database                            |
| DROP          | Will delete a given database                                          |
| DELETE        | Will delete a given element of a database                             |

SQL also has some commands that allows the user to find and order elements or data in a database:

| Command       | Use/Description                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SELECT        | A pointer which allows the user to select a database or element       | 
| FROM          | Allows the user to specify from where he wants to operate the data    | 
| WHERE         | Allows the user to check values where a condition could be met        |
| INTO          | Allows the user to specify inside of what element he wants to operate |
| GROUP BY      | Allows the user to group elements by some given attribute             |
| ORDER BY      | Allows the user to order elements by some given attribute             |

With MySQL you can also work with conditions as:

| Command       | Use/Description                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IF EXISTS     | A condition that evaluates if an element exist                        |
| IF NOT EXISTS | A condition that evaluates if an element don't exist                  |
