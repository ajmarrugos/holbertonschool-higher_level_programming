# PYTHON: Data Structures

The basic data structures in Python include:
- Lists
- Matrix (2D lists)
- Sets
- Tuples
- Dictionaries

Each of the data structures is unique in its own way. Data structures are “containers” that organize and group data according to type. The data structures differ based on mutability and order.

| File/Function                     | Use/Description                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-print_list_integer.py           | Will print all integers of a list                                 |
| 1-element_at.py                   | Retrieves an element from a list                                  |
| 2-replace_in_list.py              | Replaces an element of a list at specific position                |
| 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py  | Will print all integers of a list, in reverse order               |
| 4-new_in_list.py                  | Replaces an element in a list without modifying the original list |
| 5-no_c.py                         | Removes characters C and c from a string                          |
| 6-print_matrix_integer.py         | Prints a matrix of integers                                       |
| 7-add_tuple.py                    | Adds 2 tuples                                                     |
| 8-multiple_returns                | Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first char    |
| 9-max_integer.py                  | Finds the biggest integer of a list                               |
| 10-divisible_by_2.py              | Finds all multiples of 2 in a list                                |
| 11-delete_at.py                   | Deletes the item at a specific position in a list                 |
| 12-switch.py                      | Switch value of a and b                                           |
| 13-is_palinfrome.c                | C function that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome    |
| lists.h                           | Header file that stores C function prototypes                     |
