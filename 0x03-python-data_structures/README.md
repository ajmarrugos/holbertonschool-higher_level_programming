# PYTHON: Data Structures

The basic data structures in Python include:
- Lists
- Sets
- Tuples
- Dictionaries

Each of the data structures is unique in its own way. Data structures are “containers” that organize and group data according to type. The data structures differ based on mutability and order.

| File/Function             | Use/Description                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0-print_list_integer.py   | Will print all integers of a list |
| 1-element_at.py           |                                   |
